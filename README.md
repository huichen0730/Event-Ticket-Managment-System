# Event-Ticket-Managment-System

## Program Description

The program stimulates a waiting list management system for an event ticket selling company which will be only used by the company staff.

The program allows to maximum ten events have a waiting list at the same time. Furthermore, each waiting list can contain no more than ten people.

When a staff starts the program, the system will ask the staff to input maximum ten names for ten events which need a waiting list. Then the program will provide the main menu for the staff to choose: option 1 to print out a list of the events which have a waiting list and the current number of people in each waiting list. Option 2 is to quit the program. 

If choosing the option 1, after the list of events have been printed out, the staff is prompt to choose a specific event to manage its waiting list. After the staff have chosen a particular event, the program will display the second menu with a list of operations that the staff can operate to manage the waiting list for this chosen event. The operations include the functionalities to add a new person into the waiting list, delete the first person from the list, check a personâ€™s position in the list, reset the list to empty and return to the main menu. The program allows the staff to keep choosing different options to operate unless the staff choose to quit the program.
